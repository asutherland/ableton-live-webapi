# ableton-live-webapi
Control surface script for accessing APIs from externals scripts using ZeroMQ


ext_libs contains dependencies coming from the standard python library and other packages. Binaries have been compiled on OS X 10.10.5 but should work on any mac that is able to run Ableton Live 9. In a future version this will be removed and replaced by instructions about were to get the specific files, how to build them and hopefully a cross-platform deployment script.
